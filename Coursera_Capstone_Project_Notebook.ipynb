With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016 it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\n\nToronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\n\nHaving such a diverse mix of people and culture, there exists tough competition the restaurant business in Toronto. Therefore it becomes a challenging task for hoteliers to decide the optimal location to start a new restaurant in a specific neighborhood."
